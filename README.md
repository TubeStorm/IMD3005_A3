Flying by Hand - Nerly Saint-Fleur, Favour Diopko, Sara Mousa

## OVERVIEW
We designed our project to be like a meteorite simulation with the added effect of a switching on a different background.

 ### Controls:
- Pinch to change from the sunset to starry night
- Grab to make the meterite shower and the secret image appear
- Move the hand forward to make the astronaut float in space
- Pinch middle finger for only the secret image to appear

 ### Challenges / Solutions
- We created lasers to shoot. But when we created a class to hold the values of the several lasers we wanted to make, the code wouldn't run.
We added constructors to fix the issue, but it still wouldn't work. So this part of the project was replaced with a more meaningful feature; the
background change feature.
- Our Project then evolved into the simulation of a metorite shower. The user pinchs to change from a starry night to a sunset, and they
grab to start the shower. Once they let go of both features the simuation is set back to the defualt; which is a starry background and 
no meteorite shower.
